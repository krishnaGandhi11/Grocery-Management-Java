This project is a Java-based Grocery Management System that applies Object-Oriented Programming principles in a practical way.

While learning OOPs in theory often feels abstract, this project brought the concepts of Inheritance, Encapsulation, and Polymorphism to life.

The real “aha” moment came when I implemented the showInventory() method — replacing a long chain of if-else conditions with a single polymorphic call gItem.displayDetails().

That simple line of code proved how OOP helps in building clean, scalable, and intelligent software.

This project deepened my understanding of backend development and strengthened my confidence in writing modular and maintainable Java code.

Tech Stack: Java
Concepts: OOPs, Classes & Objects, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, Method Overriding
